# Lesson 1 {.lesson-title}

## What is GIS?

::: {.big-emoji}
üó∫Ô∏è
:::

*The Foundation*

---

## Imagine You're a Detective... {.fragment}

::: {.big-emoji .fragment}
üïµÔ∏è
:::

::: {.fragment}
But instead of solving crimes, you're solving **puzzles about our world**
:::

::: {.fragment}
Every clue has two parts:
:::

::: {.fragment .highlight-current-blue}
**WHAT** it is + **WHERE** it is
:::

---

## What Does GIS Stand For?

::: columns
::: {.column width="33%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
**Geographic**

Anything that has a location on Earth
:::
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
**Information**

Data and facts about those things
:::
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
**System**

Tools and methods that bring it all together
:::
:::
:::

---

## The Key Insight

::: {.big-emoji}
üí°
:::

::: {.fragment .spatial-highlight}
**GIS is all about answering questions that begin with "WHERE"**
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Where should we build the new hospital?
- Where are crime rates highest?
- Where will the hurricane make landfall?
- Where are the best locations for solar panels?
:::

---

## Your Coffee Shop Challenge

::: {.big-emoji}
‚òï
:::

::: {.example-highlight}
**"Where to find the best place to build a new coffee shop?"**

Perfect example of a "WHERE" question that GIS can solve!
:::

---

## The Three Magic Ingredients of GIS

::: columns
::: {.column width="33%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
::: {.big-emoji}
üìä
:::
**1. DATA**

*The Facts*

Population, competitors, traffic, income
:::
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
::: {.big-emoji}
üó∫Ô∏è
:::
**2. MAPS**

*The Visual Story*

Putting data onto maps to see patterns
:::
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
::: {.big-emoji}
üß†
:::
**3. ANALYSIS**

*The Smart Thinking*

Combining and analyzing everything
:::
:::
:::

---

## Coffee Shop: Three Locations

::: columns
::: {.column width="33%"}
::: {.tool-box}
**Location A**

‚úÖ High residential density  
‚ùå 2 competing coffee shops  
‚ùå Low car traffic
:::
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
::: {.tool-box}
**Location B**

‚ö†Ô∏è Medium residential density  
‚úÖ No competition nearby  
‚úÖ High car traffic
:::
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
::: {.tool-box}
**Location C**

‚ùå Low residential density  
‚ö†Ô∏è 1 competitor nearby  
‚ö†Ô∏è Medium car traffic
:::
:::
:::

::: {.fragment .example-highlight}
**Cultural Context Matters!** In Indonesia, coffee shops are social spaces for relaxing and hanging out.
:::

---

## Lesson 1 Summary

::: {.big-emoji}
üéâ
:::

::: {.spatial-highlight}
**What is GIS?**

A system that answers "WHERE" questions by combining:

- **Data** - Raw facts and information
- **Maps** - Visual display of data  
- **Analysis** - Smart spatial calculations
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Key Insight:** Always consider local context and culture in your analysis!
:::

---

# Lesson 2 {.lesson-title}

## Geographic Data Types

::: {.big-emoji}
üó∫Ô∏è
:::

*The Building Blocks*

---

## Imagine You're an Artist

::: {.big-emoji}
üé®
:::

Someone asks you to draw your neighborhood. You have **two approaches:**

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
**Approach 1: Shapes**

Use pencil to draw outlines - rectangles for buildings, lines for roads, dots for important places
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
**Approach 2: Pixels**

Use a grid of colored squares where each square represents what's at that location
:::
:::
:::

---

## Two Main Geographic Data Types

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
::: {.big-emoji}
üìê
:::
**Vector Data**

Digital shapes made of points, lines, and polygons

**Like:** Drawing with geometric shapes
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
::: {.big-emoji}
üî≤
:::
**Raster Data**

Grid of pixels, each containing data values

**Like:** Digital photographs with information
:::
:::
:::

---

## Vector Data: Three Basic Types

::: columns
::: {.column width="33%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
::: {.big-emoji}
üìç
:::
**Points**

Specific locations

*Coffee shops, hospitals, your house*
:::
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
::: {.big-emoji}
üìè
:::
**Lines**

Things that connect or flow

*Roads, rivers, power lines*
:::
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
::: {.big-emoji}
‚¨õ
:::
**Polygons**

Areas with boundaries

*City limits, parks, building footprints*
:::
:::
:::

---

## Coffee Shop Data Types

::: {.example-highlight}
::: columns
::: {.column width="33%"}
**Your Coffee Shop Location**

**Data Type:** Point ‚úÖ

Exact location where you want to build
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
**Neighborhood Boundaries**

**Data Type:** Polygons ‚úÖ

Areas enclosed by boundary lines
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
**Income Levels Across City**

**Data Type:** Both!

Polygons (census) or Raster (modeled)
:::
:::
:::

---

## Key Insight

::: {.big-emoji}
üí°
:::

::: {.spatial-highlight}
**The same real-world phenomenon can be represented as different data types!**

The choice depends on:
- What data is available to you
- How detailed you need to be  
- What kind of analysis you're planning
:::

---

## Earth's Address System

::: {.big-emoji}
üåç
:::

::: {.fragment .spatial-highlight}
**How do we tell a computer exactly where something is?**

Think of coordinate systems as Earth's address system - every location gets a unique "address" using numbers
:::

---

## Latitude & Longitude

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.tool-box}
**Latitude**

How far north or south

- 0¬∞ = Equator
- +90¬∞ = North Pole  
- -90¬∞ = South Pole
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.tool-box}
**Longitude**

How far east or west

- 0¬∞ = Prime Meridian
- +180¬∞ = Far east
- -180¬∞ = Far west
:::
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Jakarta:** -6.2¬∞, 106.8¬∞
:::

---

## The Projection Problem

::: {.big-emoji}
üèÄ
:::

::: {.spatial-highlight}
**Earth isn't flat, but our screens are!**

It's like trying to peel an orange and lay it perfectly flat

**Your insight:** The basketball peel would be wrinkled!

Map projections must make trade-offs - something gets distorted (shape, area, distance, or direction)
:::

---

## Indonesia's Coordinate System

::: {.spatial-highlight}
**UTM Zone 48S**

Universal Transverse Mercator optimized for Indonesia

More accurate distances and areas for local analysis
:::

::: {.fragment .example-highlight}
**Why this matters:** When analyzing your coffee shop locations in Jakarta, using UTM 48S gives you much more accurate distance measurements than global systems!
:::

---

## Geographic Data Formats

Like photos can be .jpg or .png, geographic data has special formats:

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
**Shapefile (.shp)**  
Most common, works everywhere

**GeoJSON (.geojson)**  
Web-friendly format
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
**KML (.kml)**  
Google's format

**GeoTIFF (.tif)**  
Raster data workhorse
:::
:::
:::

---

## Lesson 2 Summary

::: {.big-emoji}
üéâ
:::

::: {.spatial-highlight}
**Geographic Data Types Mastered!**

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Vector Data**

Points, Lines, Polygons  
Digital shapes
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Raster Data**

Pixel grids with values  
Continuous information
:::
:::

**Plus:** Coordinate systems, projections, and data formats
:::

---

# Lesson 3 {.lesson-title}

## Maps and Visualization

::: {.big-emoji}
üé®
:::

*Making Data Speak*

---

## Maps are Visual Stories

::: {.big-emoji}
üìñ
:::

::: {.spatial-highlight}
**Key Insight**

Raw data is like having all the ingredients for a great meal sitting on your counter.

**Visualization is the cooking that turns those ingredients into something people actually want to consume.**
:::

---

## The Power of Visualization

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.tool-box style="background: rgba(220, 53, 69, 0.2); border-color: #dc3545;"}
**‚ùå Raw Data**

"Location A has population density of 2,847 people per km¬≤"

*Hard to understand, requires mental processing*
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.tool-box style="background: rgba(40, 167, 69, 0.2); border-color: #28a745;"}
**‚úÖ Visual Story**

Map with darker green areas showing higher population density

*Instant understanding, clear patterns*
:::
:::
:::

---

## Three Rules of Good Map Design

::: columns
::: {.column width="33%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
**1. Know Your Audience**

Match the map to who's using it

*Investors need profit potential, not technical details*
:::
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
**2. Right Visual Language**

Colors and symbols that make intuitive sense

*Green for money, red for competition*
:::
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
**3. Guide the Eye**

Clear visual hierarchy

*Most important = biggest, brightest, most central*
:::
:::
:::

---

## Visual Hierarchy Pyramid

::: {.fragment}
**Level 3:** Background *(Roads, boundaries)*
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Level 2:** Supporting Cast *(Competitors, context)*
:::

::: {.fragment .spatial-highlight}
**Level 1:** The Star *(Your main message)*
:::

::: {.fragment .example-highlight}
**Coffee Shop Example:** Your 3 potential locations should be Level 1 (the star)
:::

---

## Color Theory: Three Types

::: columns
::: {.column width="33%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
**Sequential**

Gradual story (low ‚Üí high)

*Population, income, distance*
:::
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
**Categorical**

Different types

*Business types, land use*
:::
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
**Diverging**

Two-way from center

*Above/below average*
:::
:::
:::

---

## Your Color Choice: Income Levels

::: {.big-emoji}
üíö
:::

::: {.spatial-highlight}
**You chose: Gradient Colors ‚úÖ**

Perfect! Income is continuous data (low ‚Üí high)

**Light Green ‚Üí Dark Green**

Why green? People associate green with money and prosperity!
:::

---

## Golden Rules of Map Colors

::: columns
::: {.column width="33%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
**Rule 1**

Red + Green = Bad

*Colorblind people can't distinguish*
:::
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
**Rule 2**

7 Colors Maximum

*More = brain overload*
:::
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
**Rule 3**

Intuitive Colors

*Blue for water, green for parks*
:::
:::
:::

---

## Essential Map Elements

::: {.big-emoji}
üß≠
:::

**You nailed the big three!**

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
üß≠ **North Arrow** - Which way is up?

üìè **Scale** - How big is this?

üè∑Ô∏è **Legend** - What do symbols mean?
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
üìã **Title** - What am I looking at?

üìä **Data Source** - Where did this come from?

üìÖ **Date** - When was this collected?
:::
:::
:::

---

## The 5-Second Test

::: {.big-emoji}
‚è±Ô∏è
:::

::: {.spatial-highlight}
**Show your map for 5 seconds, then hide it**
:::

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box style="background: rgba(40, 167, 69, 0.2); border-color: #28a745;"}
**‚úÖ Success**

"I saw three gold stars and green areas"
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box style="background: rgba(220, 53, 69, 0.2); border-color: #dc3545;"}
**‚ùå Failure**

"Umm... lots of colors and stuff"
:::
:::
:::

---

## Every Map Tells One Story

::: {.big-emoji}
üí°
:::

::: {.spatial-highlight}
**Your Coffee Shop Story:**

*"Location B offers the best combination of high-income customers and minimal competition."*
:::

::: {.fragment .example-highlight}
**Every design choice should support this single message!**
:::

---

## Lesson 3 Summary

::: {.big-emoji}
üéâ
:::

::: {.spatial-highlight}
**Maps and Visualization Mastered!**

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Visual Stories**

Data ‚Üí Cooking ‚Üí Consumable insights

**Design Rules**

Know audience, right colors, guide the eye
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Color Theory**

Sequential, categorical, diverging

**Professional Maps**

All essential elements, clean layout
:::

# Lesson 4 {.lesson-title}

## Spatial Analysis

::: {.big-emoji}
üîç
:::

*The Real Power*

---

## What Makes Spatial Analysis Different?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
**Regular Data Analysis**

- What? How much?
- Averages, totals, trends
- Spreadsheets and charts
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment .spatial-highlight}
**Spatial Analysis**

- Where in relation to what else?
- Spatial relationships
- Maps and geographic context
:::
:::
:::

---

## Questions Only Spatial Analysis Can Answer

::: {.spatial-highlight}
- Which coffee shops are within walking distance of each other?
- How do sales change as you get farther from the city center?
- Which areas have high demand but no coffee shops nearby?
- What's the optimal delivery route to visit 10 shops?
:::

::: {.fragment .example-highlight}
**These questions can't be answered with spreadsheets alone!**
:::

---

## The Five Fundamental Spatial Relationships

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
**Distance** - How far apart are things?

**Direction** - Which way is one thing from another?

**Adjacency** - What's next to what?
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
**Containment** - What's inside what?

**Overlap** - Where do things intersect?
:::
:::
:::

---

## Your Coffee Shop Examples

::: {.example-highlight}
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Distance:** "How long to reach coffee shop from university?" *(Your example!)*

**Direction:** Which direction do students approach from?

**Adjacency:** What businesses are next to each location?
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Containment:** Which locations are inside student district?

**Overlap:** Where do catchment areas overlap?
:::
:::
:::

---

## Five Essential Spatial Analysis Tools

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
**1. Buffer Analysis**  
Show me everything within X distance

**2. Network Analysis** ‚≠ê  
Best route or travel time

**3. Overlay Analysis**  
Where do different layers intersect?
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment .tool-box}
**4. Distance Analysis**  
How far is everything from everything else?

**5. Spatial Queries**  
Find locations meeting spatial criteria
:::
:::
:::

::: {.fragment .spatial-highlight}
**You correctly identified Network Analysis for travel time questions!**
:::

---

## Tool 2: Network Analysis

::: {.big-emoji}
üõ£Ô∏è
:::

::: {.spatial-highlight}
**Your Travel Time Question!**

"How long to reach each coffee shop from university?"

Uses actual road networks for real routes and travel times
:::

::: {.fragment .example-highlight}
**Why Network, Not Buffer:** People follow roads, not straight lines! Traffic, one-way streets, and route choices all matter.
:::

---

## Hands-On: Analyzing Location B

::: {.big-emoji}
‚≠ê
:::

::: {.spatial-highlight}
**Complete 5-Tool Analysis**

Let's see how all tools work together for real business decisions
:::

---

## Location B Analysis: Steps 1-3

::: {.tool-box}
**Step 1: Buffer Analysis** - 5-minute walk buffer  
*Result: 4,050 potential customers, but 2 competitors nearby*

**Step 2: Network Analysis** - Actual walking times  
*Result: 6 min from university, 4 min from business district*

**Step 3: Overlay Analysis** - High traffic + income + low competition  
*Result: Location B sits in sweet spot where all three overlap!*
:::

---

## Location B Analysis: Steps 4-5

::: {.tool-box}
**Step 4: Distance Analysis** - Natural service area  
*Result: 12,000 potential customers in service area*

**Step 5: Spatial Query** - Check against optimal criteria  
*Result: Meets 3 of 4 criteria (excellent score!)*
:::

---

## The Verdict

::: {.big-emoji}
‚úÖ
:::

::: {.spatial-highlight}
**All Five Analyses Point to Location B!**

Best balance of accessibility, market potential, and manageable competition
:::

::: {.fragment .example-highlight}
**The Power of Spatial Analysis**

Instead of guessing, you have **quantitative evidence** supporting your decision

This analysis would be **impossible** with spreadsheets alone!
